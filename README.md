# GameTutorial
In this repo, I'lll be following along with the tutorial found at http://www.kilobolt.com/unit-2-creating-a-game-i.html

I understand that the tutorial gives you all its source code at the end, and it's super easy to copy and paste, so I'll be adding 
some personal touches to prove that I actually understand the source.
